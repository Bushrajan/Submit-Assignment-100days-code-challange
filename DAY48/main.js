Question 142: Create a Promise that resolves with "Hello, World!" after 2 seconds.
Explain & TIP: Promises in JavaScript are used for asynchronous computations and can be in one of these states: pending, fulfilled, or rejected. A Promise that resolves after a delay demonstrates how to handle operations that take some time to complete, like fetching data or timing events.

/*Question 143: Show how to use the .then() and .catch() methods to handle Promise resolution and rejection.

Explain & TIP: The .then() method is called when a Promise is successfully resolved, while .catch() is called when a Promise is rejected. Together, they provide a powerful and readable way to handle asynchronous success and error scenarios.

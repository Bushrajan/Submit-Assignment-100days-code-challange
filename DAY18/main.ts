/* ðŸš€ Day 18 Challenge: Start Coding! ðŸš€
Question 52: Make a Smartphone Object: Create a simple way to keep track of a smartphone's details. Include its brand, model, and other key features like how much storage it has, the size of its screen, and how long its battery lasts.
Explain & TIP: Just like a box can contain smaller boxes, objects can contain other objects. This helps organize related information neatly. */

/*Question 53: Pulling Apart a Nested Object: Imagine you have a list inside another list that shows what a computer programmer knows, like coding languages, tools, and software frameworks. Find a way to get three specific skills from this list and show them.
Explain & TIP: Breaking down a complex list into simpler parts makes it easier to work with and understand specific pieces of information. */

/*Question 54: Making Flexible Object Keys: Learn how to set up a list where you can change the name of each section based on what you need at that moment, like adjusting labels based on user choices.
Explain & TIP: This is like having labels you can rewrite anytime, which is great for when you need to adjust your list based on new information. */

Instead, you can install these packages locally using npm or your preferred package manager.\n\nNote: To use Next.js, you will need to have Node.js version 18.17.0 or above installed on your machine (see minimum version requirement), you can download it here.\nTo do so, create a new file in the same directory as your index.html file, called package.json with an empty object {}.\n\npackage.json \n{}\n\nIn your terminal, run the following command in the root of your project:\n\nTerminal\nnpm install react@latest react-dom@latest next@latest\nOnce the installation is complete, you should be able to see your project dependencies listed inside your package.json file:\n\ncodefile-------------------------------------package.json\n\n{\n  \"dependencies\": {\n    \"next\": \"^14.0.3\",\n    \"react\": \"^18.3.1\",\n    \"react-dom\": \"^18.3.1\"\n  }\n}\n\nDon't worry if you're on later versions than the ones shown above, as long as you have the next, react, and react-dom packages installed, you're good to go.\nYou will also notice a new file called package-lock.json file that contains detailed information about the exact versions of each package.\n\nJumping back to the index.html file, you can delete the following code:\n\nThe <html> and <body> tags.\nThe <div> element with the id of app.\nThe react and react-dom scripts since you've installed them with NPM.\nThe Babel script because Next.js has a compiler that transforms JSX into valid JavaScript browsers can understand.\nThe <script type=\"text/jsx\"> tag.\nThe document.getElementById() and ReactDom.createRoot() methods.\nThe React. part of the React.useState(0) function\n\n\n\n\n");
console.log("\n\n\n\nServer and Client Components:-\n\n\nTo understand how Server and Client Components work, it's helpful to be familiar with two foundational web concepts:\nThe environments your application code can be executed in: the server and the client.\nThe network boundary that separates server and client code.\n\nThe client refers to the browser on a user\u2019s device that sends a request to a server for your application code. It then turns the response it receives from the server into an interface the user can interact with.\nThe server refers to the computer in a data center that stores your application code, receives requests from a client, does some computation, and sends back an appropriate response.\n\nEach environment has its own set of capabilities and constraints. For example, by moving rendering and data fetching to the server, you can reduce the amount of code sent to the client, which can improve your application's performance. But, as you learned earlier, to make your UI interactive, you need to update the DOM on the client. \n\nTherefore, the code you write for the server and the client is not always the same. Certain operations (e.g. data fetching or managing user state) are better suited for one environment over the other.\n\n\nNetwork Boundary:-\nThe Network Boundary is a conceptual line that separates the different environments.\n\nIn React, you choose where to place the network boundary in your component tree. For example, you can fetch data and render a user's posts on the server (using Server Components), then render the interactive LikeButton for each post on the client (using Client Components).\n\ncode-----------------------------------------------------------------/app/like-button.js\nexport default function LikeButton() {}\n\n\ncode-----------------------------------------------------------------/app/like-button.js\nexport default function LikeButton() {\n  function handleClick() {\n    setLikes(likes + 1);\n  }\n \n  return <button onClick={handleClick}>Like ({likes})</button>;\n}\n\n\ncode------------------------------------------------------------/app/like-button.js\nimport { useState } from 'react'; \nexport default function LikeButton() {\n  const [likes, setLikes] = useState(0);\n  \n  function handleClick() {\n    setLikes(likes + 1);\n  }\n \n  return <button onClick={handleClick}>Like ({likes})</button>;\n}\n\n\ncode------------------------------------------------------------/app/like-button.js\n'use client';\n \nimport { useState } from 'react'; \nexport default function LikeButton() {\n  const [likes, setLikes] = useState(0);\n \n  function handleClick() {\n    setLikes(likes + 1);\n  }\n \n  return <button onClick={handleClick}>Like ({likes})</button>;\n}\n\n\ncode------------------------------------------------------------------/app/page.js\nimport LikeButton from './like-button';\nfunction Header({ title }) {\n  return <h1>{title ? title : 'Default title'}</h1>;\n}\n \nexport default function HomePage() {\n  const names = ['Ada Lovelace', 'Grace Hopper', 'Margaret Hamilton'];\n \n  return (\n    <div>\n      <Header title=\"Develop.

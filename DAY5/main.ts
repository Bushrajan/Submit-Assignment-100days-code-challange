/* üöÄ Day 5 Challenge: Start Coding! üöÄ

Question 13: Your Own Array: Think of your favorite mode of transportation,
such as a motorcycle or a car, and make a list that stores several examples.
Use your list to print a series of statements about these items, such as ‚ÄúI would like to own a Honda motorcycle.‚Äù Explain & TIP: Arrays help you group related items,
like types of transportation. This way, you can talk about each one using a loop. */
console.log("\nxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx Day5_Q1: xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx\n");
let array:string[]= ['Bike','Car','Trola']
let message = " ‚ÄúI would like to own a Honda motorcycle.‚Äù "

array.forEach(array => {
    console.log(`${array} ‚ÄúI would like to own a Honda motorcycle.‚Äù `);
});

/* Question 14: Guest List: If you could invite anyone, living or
deceased, to dinner, who would you invite? Make a list that includes at least three people you‚Äôd like to invite to dinner. Then use your list to print a message to each person, inviting them to dinner. Explain & TIP: Just like with transportation, you can use an array to manage a list of guests.
Loop through the list to send each one a personal invitation. */
console.log("\nxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx Day5_Q1: xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx\n");

/* Question 15: Changing Guest List: One of your guests can't make it to the
dinner, so you need to send out a new set of invitations with a replacement guest.
Explain & TIP: Arrays are flexible. You can replace an item if someone can't make 
it, then loop through the list again for new invitations. */

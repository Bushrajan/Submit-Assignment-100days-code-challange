/* ðŸš€ Day 7 Challenge: Start Coding! ðŸš€

Question 19: Dinner Guests: Use one of your programs from Exercises 14 through 18 to print a message indicating the number of people you are inviting to dinner.
Explain & TIP: Arrays have a length property that tells you how many items are in the list. Use this to inform your guests how big the party will be. */
console.log("\nxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx Day7_Q1: xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx\n");
let guests:string[]=['Lee John','Victor','John Marvick','Aliya']
    console.log(`${guests.length} Dinner is on me .`);

/*Question 20: Think of something you could store in an array. For example, you could make a list of mountains, rivers, countries, cities, languages, or anything else youâ€™d like. Write a program that creates a list containing these items.
Explain & TIP: Arrays are perfect for keeping a collection of similar items. Choose a theme you like and list several examples. */

let like_countries: string[] = ["Korea", "Japan", "Itlay", "Paris", "Uman"];
console.log("I'd like to enjoy photos of these contries:", like_countries);

/*Question 21: Think of something you could store in a TypeScript Object. Write a program that creates Objects containing these items.
Explain & TIP: Objects in TypeScript can store various related data about a single entity. Think of an object as a container for characteristics of something, like a book or a car.

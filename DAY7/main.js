/*Question 20: Think of something you could store in an array. For example, you could make a list of mountains, rivers, countries, cities, languages, or anything else you’d like. Write a program that creates a list containing these items.

/*Question 21: Think of something you could store in a TypeScript Object. Write a program that creates Objects containing these items.

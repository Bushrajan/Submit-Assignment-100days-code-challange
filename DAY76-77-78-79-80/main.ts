Day-76 Task:
Read and understand the following Visual Guide about DNS and DHCP.
 */
console.log(`\nWhat is DNS?\nAns: Domain Name system server ( DNS Server). Browser can't open any website without knowing its IP address for it. IP adress assigned to every device on interner. You can either type the IP Address to open, or provide the domain name and press enter which will then be used by your browser to find the IP address by going through several hoops. And then you will see the result on yourn device.`);
console.log(`\nWhat is DHCP?\nAns: Dynamit Host Congiguration Protocol (DHCP). It works as through DHCP Client & DHCP server. When ever the new people come to your house and connect their devices with same wifi network that has unique IP Address, you have seen the process before but you didn't know what is going behind on your device and somehow surprise that it is connected. I will tell you that the process when you enter the passcode on new devices you have seen the authetication process going in seconds and there you go with the unlimited connection. The process behind  is called (DHCP) work.`);

Read and understand the following Visual Guide about the Web Vitals.*/
console.log(`\nWhat are Web Vitals?\nAns: Web Vitals is a Google initiative to provide unified guidance for web page quality signals that are essential to delivering a great user experience on the web. Although Core Web Vitals metrics evolve over time, currently, there are three main pillars developers should focus on: loading, interactivity, and visual stability. Those related metrics consist of Largest Contentful Paint (LCP), First Input Delay (FID) and Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS).`);

Day-79 Task:
Read the following Articles with interactive video about Basics of Authentication and HTTP Basic Authentication. */
console.log(`\nBasics of  Authentication\nAns: Basic authentication involves proving a user is who they say they are through authentication methods such as a username and password, biometric information such as facial recognition or fingerprint scans, and phone or text confirmations (which are most often used as part of two-factor authentication methods). `);
console.log(`\nHTTP Basic Authentication\nAns: HTTP Basic authentication (BA) implementation is the simplest technique for enforcing access controls to web resources because it does not require cookies, session identifiers, or login pages; rather, HTTP Basic authentication uses standard fields in the HTTP header. Authentication is a protocol used in HTTP communication to verify that a client is who they say they are before providing the client access to a certain resource on the web.`);
